# tasks-CRUD
Tasks app made with node-js and mongodb


I created this web based in Fazt tutorial: node-js & mongodb CRUD. 
I learned about express, node-js, moongoDB, mongoose, handlebars and some of the dependences that this CRUD needed to be deployed on HEROKU.

You can access the web here: https://tasks-app-agrigaliunas.herokuapp.com/
