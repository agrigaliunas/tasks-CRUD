<h1>Tasks CRUD app made with node.js and mongodb</h1>


I created this web based in Fazt tutorial: node-js & mongodb CRUD. 
<br>
<br>

<i>Making this, I learned the basics about MVC, Express, Nodejs, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, Handlebars, environment variables and some of the dependences that this CRUD needed to be deployed on HEROKU.

  <h2>You can access and test the CRUD here: https://tasks-app-agrigaliunas.herokuapp.com/</h2>
